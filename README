This directory contains files for an OSM flyer (in German) that was
created by Frederik Ramm <frederik@remote.org> and contributors from 
the talk-de list in January 2008, and subsequently updated over the
years. The latest version was mainly made by Soeren Gasch
<soeren@geofabrik.de>.

All contents are in the public domain except those derived from OSM 
which are CC-BY-SA.

The flyer is designed for DIN A7 as the final size (105mm high and
74mm wide), with 8 pages in a zig-zag ("Leporello") fold, and full
colour printing.

The flyer was made with Inkscape; osmflyer1.svg and osmflyer2.svg
are the front and reverse side. 

Some notes in case you want to re-create something yourself:

berlin-background.png is basically a 4-year-old Osmarender rendering 
of Berlin, using a standard stylesheet but with all captions removed, 
and the resulting PNG file processed with the Gimp roughly like this: 
First convert to grayscale, then use colors->curves to narrow down 
contrast, then convert back to RGB, then use colors->colorify to give 
it a nice hue.

The file TRANSLATION has a rough translation of the contents.

The cover globe image was made with Marble, the technique is roughly
outlined here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Marble
