Why a free world map?

There are lots of no-fee city plans and maps on the Internet. But most
are only for private use and must not be re-published. In a flyer like
this we would not be allowed to print them, for example. Plus, they're
often not current and not complete. Errors are fixed only slowly.

The most important thing is that you only get map images but not the
data from which they were created. You need that data if you want to
create your own maps or use the map on a variety of devices, for
example for routing.

Because of that, OpenStreetMap has people like you and me collecting
raw data themselves - world-wide, sometimes as a team and sometimes on
their own. With our own data an our own software we become independent
of commercial providers. As in Wikipedia, everybody can take part.

How does OpenstreetMap work?

The map data for OpenStreetMap is collected in various ways. A GPS 
device and manual notes are the traditional tools of the trade;
the *GPS track* is a recording of the way the surveyor (we call them
"mappers") has traveled. Today, the project can also frequently make
use of good *aerial imagery*.

An *editor* specially developed for OSM shows the aerial imagery and 
the GPS tracks, and also data already present in OSM. Street geometries,
building outlines, forests or lakes can be traced from aerial imagery,
but information like house numbers, street names, or "points of interest"
are missing from such images. Such data can only be added if you know
the place well - or if you travel there for surveying.

Afterwards, results are uploaded to the central project database, and
the *finished map* is computed. Shortly thereafter, the new changes
are visible for everyone.

The English-language project start page is at www.openstreetmap.org.
There's also a Wiki with a lot of project information and of course
the world map viewer. At www.openstreetmap.de you will find a German
introduction with links to forums and mailing lists.
